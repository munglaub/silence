Building/Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run Silence properly it needs to be installed. For developing purposes a
local installation may be the best way. The following commands checkout
the current version of Silence into your home directory, compile and install
it inside the silence direcory.

cd
git clone git://gitorious.org/silence/silence.git
cd silence
mkdir build install
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/username/silence/install
make
make install

run with: ../install/bin/silence

If you want to compile it for real use you can use the following commands:

git clone git://gitorious.org/silence/silence.git
cd silence
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
# as root:
make install

Now Silence should appear in your menu and you can start it from the
commandline by typing in "silence".
